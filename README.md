# manVcat

manVcat or man v/s cat is a 2D shooter developed for  my 4th semester Computer Graphics project. The project is written in **C++11** and uses the **OpenGL** platform. 

It implements
*  a custom polygon fill function and the general Breshenham Line alorithm,
* an Model-based design system to streamline and simplify designing and implement characters and objects.
* a custom collision detection system.
* an A-star driven path-finding system to guide different motions. 


## Scene

Your cat was bit by a rabid dog and is now wandering mindlessly in your
backyard. The vet is on his way but you, along with your brother Astar,
have to contain your cat till then. Don’t get too close to it though!
Remember, it’s rabid. Use your remote controlled tank to neutralize you
cat. 9 direct hits and he will go to sleep.
